<A NAME="section1"></A><HR><H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
 
This document gives a brief description of the various command line
programs available in the FLIRT component of FSL.  A description of
the GUI interface is contained in another document.

<P>
For each of the programs described here, a full list of available options
can be obtained by running the command with no options.

<A NAME="section2"></A><HR><H2>FLIRT</H2>
 
<I>flirt</I> is the main program that performs affine registration.  It takes
an input (<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-in</FONT>) and a reference
(<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-ref</FONT>) volume, and then calculates the affine
transformation that registers the input to the reference.  The
transformation can be saved as a 4x4 affine matrix
(<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-omat</FONT>) or as a MEDx transform
(<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-omedx</FONT>).

<P>
In addition, FLIRT can also be used to apply a saved transformation to
a volume (<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-applyxfm</FONT> and <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-out</FONT>).  For
this usage the reference volume must still be specified as this sets
the voxel and image dimensions of the resulting volume.
<br>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=ORANGE>New Features:</FONT><br>
<UL>
<LI> Cost Function Weighting.  Weighting volumes can be specified
using <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-refweight</FONT>, <FONT
COLOR=PURPLE>-inweight</FONT> (or both).  This allows the cost
function to have a different weighting at each voxel, which is useful
for excluding areas (weight=0) of no interest, or increasing the
weighting around important structures such as the ventricles.  Note
that this is different from masking the original images, as masking introduces
artificial boundaries whereas weighting does not.
<LI> Different Interpolation Methods.  This includes Nearest Neighbour and
a family of Sinc-based methods (three window types - rectangular, Hanning and
Blackman) with configurable window width.  The interpolation is only used
for the final transformation (and in applyxfm), not in the registration
calculations.
<LI> 2D Rigid-Body Mode.  This allows 2D to 2D registrations to be performed.
This is selected with the <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-2D</FONT> option.  Note that
it does not perform any search in this mode, and cannot deal with 2D to 3D
registrations.

<A NAME="section3"></A><HR><H2>CONVERT_XFM</H2>
 
<I>convert_xfm</I> is a utility that is used to convert between different
transformation file formats.  It can read and write ascii 4x4 matrices
and MEDx transforms as well as reading MINC transform files.  In
addition, it can be used to concatenate two transforms (using
<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-concat</FONT> with the second transform) or to find the
inverse transformation (using <FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-inverse</FONT>).

<P>
As MEDx transformations require voxel dimensions, the input and
reference volume corresponding to the transformation must be specified
when using this command.  However, if only ascii files are used, the
<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>-matonly</FONT> option can be used, in which case no volumes
need to be specified.

<A NAME="section4"></A><HR><H2>RMSDIFF</H2>
 
<I>rmsdiff</I> is a utility that calculates the Root Mean Square deviation
(in millimetres) between two transformations.  That is, it compares
two transformations (normally two possible registrations of the same
volume pair) to see how much they differ.  This is useful to compare
alternative registrations.

<A NAME="section5"></A><HR><H2>AVSCALE</H2>
 
<I>avscale</I> is a utility that displays the decomposed elements of an
affine matrix.  It displays the rotation/translation matrix, the
individual axis scalings, the individual skews, the average scaling,
and the forward and backward halfway transformations.  In order to set
the centre of rotation it requires the input volume (also called the
reslice volume).

<A NAME="section6"></A><HR><H2>APPLYXFM</H2>
 
<I>applyxfm</I> is a utility that transforms an image by applying a
known affine transformation to it.  It can be used for single volumes
or for 4D series.  Note that it always uses trilinear interpolation, while
appropriate options (-applyxfm and -init) to FLIRT can be used to apply 
transformations to single volumes with other interpolation methods.
A reference volume is required in order to determine the matrix size and
FOV for the final volume.

<A NAME="section7"></A><HR><H2>IMG2IMGCOORD</H2>
 
<I>img2imgcoord</I> is a utility that calculates the corresponding
coordinate positions (in voxels or mm) within a destination volume
given the original coordinates in the source volume and the transformation
from the source to the destination volume.  This is useful for finding
corresponding anatomical/functional locations.  Note that the source
coordinates need to be stored in a file as three numbers per line, space
separated.

<A NAME="section8"></A><HR><H2>EPI2TALCOORD</H2>
 
<I>epi2talcoord</I> is a similar utility to <I>img2imgcoord</I>
except that the destination volume coordinates are treated as Talairach
space coordinates.  This requires the Talairach volume to have the
origin coordinates and voxel dimensions entered in the correct analyse
header fields.  (Note that this has only been tested with the standard
images contained in fsl/etc/standard - there is no guarantee with other
images, as the origin is not a standard analyse header field)


 <!-- J-Back -->

<A NAME="section9"></A><HR><H2>TAL2EPICOORD</H2>
 
<I>tal2epicoord</I> is the complementary utility to <I>epi2talcoord</I>.
It works the same way but transfers coordinates from Talairach space to
the other image (EPI) space.
